                    <p>Meet Dr. Sebi, a pathologist, biochemist and herbalist. He came to the U.S. from Honduras and is on a mission to heal humanity. As it happens, he has been curing some of the most deadly diseases on the planet for almost 30 years. AIDS, cancer, diabetes, lupus and epilepsy are just a few of the ailments he has completely reversed. In fact, he is so committed to his work that he took on the Attorney General of New York in a Supreme Court trial — and won.</p>

                    <h3>Standing Up to the Food and Drug Administration</h3>

                    <p>Back in the 1980’s, Dr. Sebi ran a variety of ads in newspapers like the New York Post, stating: “AIDS has been cured by the Usha Research Institute, and we specialize in cures for Sickle Cell, Lupus, Blindness, Herpes, Cancer and others.” The ad caught the eye of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the agency subsequently sued Dr. Sebi for false advertisement and practicing without a license.</p>

                    <p>The judge presiding over the case requested that Dr. Sebi provide one witness for each disease he claimed to have cured. When he instead furnished 70 witnesses to support his argument — showing without a doubt that he did in truth heal all the diseases listed in the ad — the judge declared the doctor not guilty on all counts.</p>

                    <p>Even with his outstanding victory in court, along with testimonials from celebrities and a multitude of people cured by his method, Dr. Sebi’s protocol is still suppressed to this day.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Healing with Electric Foods and Botanicals</h2>

                    <p>The basis behind Dr. Sebi’s approach is clearing the body of excessive mucous, which is believed to be the root of all disease. He explains:</p>

                    <blockquote style="color: #ffc300">“Our research reveals that all manifestation of disease finds it genesis when and where the mucous membrane has been compromised. For example, if there is excess mucous in the bronchial tubes, the disease is bronchitis; if it is in the lungs, the disease is pneumonia; in the pancreatic duct, it is diabetes; in the joints, arthritis.”</blockquote>

                    <p>Moreover, mucous in the retina of the eye will cause blindness; if it is found around the thyroid gland, cancer of the thyroid is the result. Basically, disease will arise in the body wherever there’s an accumulation of this stagnant toxin.</p>

                    <p>According to Dr. Sebi, blood and starch in the diet are the main reasons we can be overrun with clogging plaque. He believes starch is a chemical that wreaks havoc on health, mainly because it causes acidity within the body. The same with animal products. On the whole, an acid body will create toxic mucous and congest the system — leading to inflammation, whereas an alkaline pH will do just the opposite and support vitality.</p>

                    <p>You may have guessed by this point that consuming an alkaline diet is key. But Dr. Sebi takes his protocol a step further by recommending fasting, along with taking botanical remedies which detox each cell and replace depleted minerals.</p>

                    <p>The remedies are classified as natural vegetation cell food and nourish cells at a very deep level. Because of this, many find their appetite disappears when they begin using the botanicals. Dr. Sebi notes:</p>

                    <blockquote style="color: #ffc300">“Although the natural vegetation cell food compounds were designed to extract mucus from a given area of the body, it is also necessary for the body to be cleansed as a whole. What makes our compounds unique is the manner in which they work to cleanse and nourish the entire body.”</blockquote>

                    <p>The healing diet is found below. It’s important to keep in mind that “Dr. Sebi has recommended the foods that are listed here for the reversal of disease for over 30 years. If your favorite food is missing from the list, our research and results have proven that it has no nutritional value and may be detrimental to your health.”</p>
